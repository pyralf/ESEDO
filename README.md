>Energy System Economic Dispatch with Optimization

## Assignment 3 from: Energy System Modeling with Python, INATECH Freiburg.

An Economic Dispatch Model is a mathematical formulation (usually as an optimization problem) used
in power system operation to ensure that the generation of electricity meets the current demand in the
most economical (cost-effective) manner.
The core idea of economic dispatch is to determine the optimal output of various generation units so that
the total power demand is met at the lowest possible cost. Each generation unit, like a power plant, has
its own operational characteristics, including fuel costs, maintenance expenses, and output limitations.
These factors are critical in deciding how much each unit should contribute to the total power supply.
